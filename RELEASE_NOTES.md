# Devalaya Pro v1.6.0 - The Panchangam Update

We are excited to announce a major update focused on Malayalam Calendar integration and enhanced billing workflows.

### 🌟 New: Malayalam Calendar & Star Integration
- **Advanced Star Tracking**: The system now contains a built-in astronomical engine to accurately calculate Nakshatras (Stars) offline.
- **Star Finder Tool**: Easily find upcoming dates for a specific star (e.g., "When is the next Rohini?").
- **Extended Search**: Find star occurrences for the "Next 5", "6 Months", or "1 Year".
- **One-Click Replication**: Instantly book Vazhipadus for a chosen star for the entire year with a single click.
- **Malayalam Date Display**: The system now displays the Malayalam Date (Kollavarsham) next to Gregorian dates to assist with booking accuracy.

### ⚡ Billing Enhancements
- **Smart Star Input**: The star search now intelligently auto-selects the previously entered star, speeding up the workflow.
- **Clear All Batch**: Added a "Clear All" button to quickly discard large batches of generated bills.
- **Print Overlay Improvements**: The printing screen now prominently displays the **Total Amount to Collect** from the devotee.
- **Security Lock**: Added a persistent payment confirmation screen that blocks new actions until the current bill's payment status is confirmed (Paid or Pay Later), preventing bypass attempts.
- **Clarity Update**: Updated the "Pay Later" prompt to clearly ask for the "Booking Devotee's Phone Number".

### 🛠️ Fixes & Improvements
- **Startup Stability**: Resolved a potential crash issue in the Manager script caused by duplicate route definitions.
- **Visual Upgrades**: Increased the legibility of the "Star of the Day" badge on the billing screen.
